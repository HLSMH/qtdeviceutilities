    Take the following steps when preparing an
    \l {http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/overview.html}{Intel NUC}
    for \B2Q:

    \note It is important that you repeat the steps in this section after you
    update \SDK.

    The images containing the \B2Q stack for the device are included
    in \SDK. In these instructions, we prepare a USB device (a flash drive
    or an external USB hard drive) to boot from.

    \section1 Preparing a USB Boot Device

    For \B2Q, a USB drive of at least 2 GB capacity is needed.

    \include detect-sd-card-device-name.qdocinc instructions-usbdevice

    \section1 Installing the \B2Q Image

    \include common.qdocinc wizard

    Install the \B2Q image onto the USB device. First, ensure that no
    partitions are mounted:

    \include detect-sd-card-device-name.qdocinc unmount

    Then, use the following command to install the image:

    \badcode
        cd <INSTALL_DIR>
        sudo dd bs=4k if=5.7/Automotive/intel-corei7-64/images/b2qt-embedded-qt5-image-intel-corei7-64.img of=/dev/<device_name>
    \endcode

    After the installation is complete, connect the USB drive to the device,
    power it on, and enter the BIOS setup (\b F2). Follow the instructions on
    \l {http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/boards-and-kits/000005471.html}
    {Operating System Installation for IntelÂ® NUC} for how to select the
    USB drive as a boot device.

    Press \b F10 to save your changes and exit BIOS setup. After reboot, check that the
    \B2Q welcome screen and/or demo appear.

    \section1 Setting up USB Access

    \include b2qt-post-install-setup.qdocinc setting up usb access

    \section1 Configuring a Device Kit in Qt Creator

    \include b2qt-post-install-setup.qdocinc configuring device kit linux

    You are now ready to start developing for your device. For more information,
    see \l{Building and Running an Example}.
