    Before you can deploy and test your Qt application on hardware, you must
    flash the target device with an image that contains the
    \B2Q stack. These steps vary from device to device:

    \list
        \li \l{Nexus 7 (2012/2013) (embedded Android)}
        \li \l{BD-SL-i.MX6 (embedded Android and Linux)}
        \li \l{SABRE SD i.MX6Quad (embedded Linux)}
        \li \l{Toradex Apalis iMX6 (embedded Linux)}
        \li \l{BeagleBone Black (embedded Android and Linux)}
        \li \l{BeagleBoard-xM (embedded Linux)}
        \li \l{Raspberry Pi Model B (embedded Linux)}
    \endlist

    If you use only the emulator, you can skip this step
    and continue straight to \l {Building and Running an Example}.

    \section1 Supported Reference Devices

    The \B2Q stack can be made to run on a variety of hardware. For \SDK license
    holders, tooling is provided to customize the contents of the stack as well
    as to take it into desired production hardware. For more information on how
    to customize the stack for embedded Linux, see
    \l {Building Your Own Embedded Linux Image}.

    Approximate minimal hardware requirements for running \B2Q are:
    \list
        \li 256 MB of RAM
        \li 500 MHz CPU, 1 GHz preferred for 60-FPS velvet-smooth UI
        \li OpenGL ES 2.0 support
    \endlist

    \B2QA requires hardware that has support for the Android operating
    system, version 4.2 or later.

    \B2Q software stack is provided pre-built, tested and supported for the
    following hardware:
    \list
        \li \l{http://www.google.com/nexus/7/specs/}
            {Google/Asus Nexus 7 (2012 and 2013 models)}
        \li \l{http://beagleboard.org/products/beaglebone%20black}
            {BeagleBone Black}
        \li \l{http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/prod_summary.jsp?code=RDIMX6SABREBRD}
            {Freescale SABRE SD i.MX6Quad}
        \li \l{http://boundarydevices.com/products/sabre-lite-imx6-sbc/}
            {BD-SL-i.MX6}
        \li \l{http://www.toradex.com/products/apalis-arm-computer-modules/freescale-imx-6-computer-module}
            {Toradex Apalis iMX6}
        \li \l{http://www.raspberrypi.org/faqs}
            {Raspberry Pi Model B}
    \endlist

    \section2 Supported Features on Reference Devices

    The following features are supported without any modification on the
    pre-built images available for the reference devices:
